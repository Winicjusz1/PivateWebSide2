# PivateWebSide2
This is my second website project called "Private Web Side 2". It is a five-page responsive website, built on Bootstrap, using various data sources to build it. It shows the possibility of modifying class Bootstrap and ready-made Bootstrap solutions in order to adapt the website to the user's needs, taking into account different screen sizes. You can easily connect javascript to such a website in order to give it various functionalities. My previous private website at www.winicjusz.keep.pl had a lot of errors and "bad practices" - solving a given problem only temporarily, but it was the best code that I could generate independently, without anyone's help, in September 2020r.  While building the current site, I didn't use the BEM syntax, or the SASS preprocessor and webpack, but I showed my knowledge of these technologies in other projects suspended on github.
